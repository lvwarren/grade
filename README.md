Python Notebook: A Statistical Study of Orthodox and Novel Grading Strategies

How Does A Novel Grading Policy Affect Assigned Grade?

Group A students (orthodox) not handing in an assignment receive  0/100 points.<br>
Group B students (novel)    not handing in an assignment receive 50/100 points.

My question is, how does this affect the distribution of letter grades?

To discover the answer run this entire python notebook, scroll to the bottom
and interact with the sliders.

Keep in mind that each run is a statistical experiment of its own.
For best results run more than one experiment.

You can set max_grade at the top to see results on a 4.0 or 100 percent scale.
Changing max_grade requires that the entire sheet to be re-executed.
